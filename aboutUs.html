                Hi! I'm Irene Yu, a first year graduate sutudent at UMSI on UX track. I love traveling—not just for the adventure, but also for preserving the memories that come with it. Cultural derivatives and souvenirs help capture those moments and allow me to share them with family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                This summer, I helped my sister at her design studio, which specializes in designing city-inspired cultural derivative and souvenirs. I realized their beautiful work needed a space to shine online, so I created this page to showcase their designs. I hope it brings you the same joy and inspiration that traveling brings to me.
